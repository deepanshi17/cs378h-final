# CS 378H Final Project: Virtual World Simulation

A computer graphics simulation to procedurally generate an infinite virtual world.

## Run demo:
* Install node and npm: [NodeJS and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
* Navigate to project root directory
* Install npm packages: `npm install`
* Start the local server: `npm run start`
* Go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## Keys:
* Arrow keys toggle between camera angles.
* W-A-S-D keys are used to control flight 
* Toolbar on right-hand side can be used to adjust several other features such as velocity, noise, and height
